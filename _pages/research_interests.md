I am mostly interested in problems coming from the mean-field theory of electric neuronal activity and the associated partial differential equations:

- **PDEs of mathematical neuroscience** (notably in link with the Network of noisy integrate and fire neurons model)

- **Kinetic Fokker-Planck equations**

- **Numerical analysis of partial differential equations**
